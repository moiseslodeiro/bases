/**
 * Write a class called Name and create the following attributes given a first name and last name (as fname and lname):

An attribute called fullname which returns the first and last names.
An attribute called initials which returns the first letters of the first and last name. Put a . between the two letters.
Remember to allow the attributes fname and lname to be accessed individually as well.
getWeight() returns "name weighs weightkg"

Examples
a1 = new Name("john", "SMITH")
a1.fname ➞ "John"

a1.lname ➞ "Smith"

a1.fullname ➞ "John Smith"

a1.initials ➞ "J.S"

Notes:
Make sure only the first letter of each name is capitalised.
